# Regular Expressions (Regex) Tutorial

Welcome to the Regular Expressions (Regex) Tutorial! This tutorial aims to provide a understanding of regular expressions and applications in text processing. Whether you are new to regex or want to enhance your skills, this guide will you with the knowledge needed to leverage regex effectively.

## Summary

In this tutorial, we will focus on understanding a specific regex pattern used for matching email addresses. The regex we will be exploring is:

```regex
/^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/
```

This regex is designed to validate email addresses by breaking them down into three main components: the username part, the domain part, and the top-level domain (TLD). I will explain each part of the regex in detail, providing insights into how it works and what each component does.

## Regex Components

### Anchors

In this section, we will explain what anchors are in regex and how they allow us to match patterns at specific positions in the text. Anchors help ensure that the regex pattern is applied at the beginning or end of a line or a specific word boundary.

### Quantifiers

Quantifiers define the number of times a character or a group of characters should appear in the text to match the regex pattern. In this section, we will explore various quantifiers and their applications in regex.

### Grouping Constructs

Grouping constructs are essential for creating logical units within the regex pattern. By grouping characters together, we can apply quantifiers or other operators to treat them as a single unit. This section will cover different grouping constructs and their significance.

### Bracket Expressions

Bracket expressions, also known as character classes, allow us to define a set of characters that we want to match. We'll explain how to use brackets to match specific characters or ranges of characters.

### Character Classes

Character classes offer a convenient way to match a specific category of characters. In this section, we'll dive into various predefined character classes and explore how to use them effectively.

### The OR Operator

The OR operator enables us to create alternate options in the regex pattern. We'll learn how to use the OR operator to match multiple patterns in this section.

### Flags

Flags in regex modify the behavior of the pattern matching. We'll discuss the most commonly used flags and how they can influence the regex outcome.

### Character Escapes

Character escapes allow us to match special characters in the text that would otherwise be interpreted as regex metacharacters. We'll explore how to use character escapes to match literal characters in this section.
