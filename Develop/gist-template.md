# Regular Expressions (Regex) Tutorial

Welcome to the Regular Expressions (Regex) Tutorial. This tutorial aims to provide a understanding of regular expressions and applications in text processing. This guide will you with the knowledge needed to leverage regex effectively.

## Summary

In this tutorial, we will focus on understanding a specific regex pattern used for matching email addresses. The regex we will be exploring is:

```regex
/^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/
```

This regex is designed to validate email addresses by breaking them down into three main components: the username part, the domain part, and the top-level domain (TLD). I will explain each part of the regex in detail, providing insights into how it works and what each component does.

## Regex Components

In this section, we will explain the various components of the given email matching regex: 

```regex
/^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/
```

### Anchors

Anchors are used to specify positions in the text where the regex pattern should match. The `^` at the beginning of the regex and the `$` at the end are anchors.

Example:
Suppose we have the following text:
```
john.doe@example.com
```
The regex `/^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/` will match this entire email address because the `^` anchor specifies that the pattern must start at the beginning of the line, and the `$` anchor specifies that it must end at the end of the line.

### Quantifiers

Quantifiers control the number of times a character or a group of characters can appear in the text.

Example:
Suppose we have the following text:
```
john.doe@example.com
```
The regex `/([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})/` will match the following:
- `john.doe` as the username (due to the `+` quantifier after the character class)
- `example` as the domain name (due to the `+` quantifier after the character class)
- `.com` as the top-level domain (TLD) (due to the `{2,6}` quantifier specifying 2 to 6 characters for the TLD)

### Grouping Constructs

Grouping constructs allow us to treat multiple characters as a single unit and apply quantifiers or other operators to them.

Example:
Suppose we have the following text:
```
john.doe@example.com
```
The regex `/^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/` will match the following:
- Group 1: `john.doe` (due to the parentheses `()` around the username part)
- Group 2: `example` (due to the parentheses `()` around the domain name part)
- Group 3: `.com` (due to the parentheses `()` around the TLD part)

### Bracket Expressions

Bracket expressions, also known as character classes, allow us to define sets of characters to match.

Example:
Suppose we have the following text:
```
john.doe@example.com
```
The regex `/^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/` will match the following:
- `[a-z0-9_\.-]`: This character class matches any lowercase letter, digit, underscore, period (.), or hyphen (-) in the username.
- `[\da-z\.-]`: This character class matches any digit, lowercase letter, period (.), or hyphen (-) in the domain name.

### Character Classes

Character classes allow us to match specific categories of characters.

Example:
Suppose we have the following text:
```
john.doe@example.com
```
The regex `/^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/` will match the following:
- `\d`: This special sequence matches any digit in the domain name.

### The OR Operator

The OR operator `|` allows us to specify multiple alternatives for the regex pattern.

Example:
Suppose we have the following text:
```
john.doe@example.com
```
The regex `/^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@(example|test)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/` will match the following:
- `john.doe@example.com`: This will match as the domain can be either `example` or `test`.

### Flags

Flags in regex modify the behavior of the pattern matching.

Example:
Suppose we have the following text:
```
JOHN.doe@example.com
```
The regex `/^([a-zA-Z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-zA-Z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/i` will match the following:
- `JOHN.doe@example.com`: This will match as the `i` flag is used to perform a case-insensitive match, allowing both uppercase and lowercase characters.

### Character Escapes

Character escapes allow us to match special characters in the text that would otherwise be interpreted as regex metacharacters.

Example:
Suppose we have the following text:
```
john_doe@example.com
```
The regex `/^([a-z0-9_\.\-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/` will match the following:
- `john_doe@example.com`: This will match as the hyphen `-` in the username is escaped with a backslash `\` to be treated as a literal hyphen.

## Explanation:

```
[  ^  ]: Anchor - Matches the start of a line.

[  (  ]: Grouping Construct - Starts a capturing group for the username.

[  [a-z0-9_\.-]+  ]: Character Class + Quantifier - Matches one or more lowercase letters, digits, underscores, periods, or hyphens (username).

[  )  ]: Grouping Construct - Ends the capturing group for the username.

[  @  ]: Literal - Matches the "@" symbol.

[  (  ]: Grouping Construct - Starts a capturing group for the domain name.

[  [\da-z\.-]+  ]: Character Class + Quantifier - Matches one or more digits, lowercase letters, periods, or hyphens (domain name).

[  )  ]: Grouping Construct - Ends the capturing group for the domain name.

[  \.  ]: Escape + Literal - Matches the "." symbol (escaped because "." is a metacharacter).

[  (  ]: Grouping Construct - Starts a capturing group for the top-level domain (TLD).

[  [a-z\.]{2,6}  ]: Character Class + Quantifier - Matches 2 to 6 lowercase letters or periods (TLD).

[  )  ]: Grouping Construct - Ends the capturing group for the TLD.

[  $  ]: Anchor - Matches the end of a line.
```
### more Examples:
```
Suppose we have the following text:

john.doe@example.com

The regex /^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/ will match the following:

-[  `john.doe`  ]: as the username (due to the `+` quantifier after the character class `[a-z0-9_\.-]`).

-[  `example`  ]: as the domain name (due to the `+` quantifier after the character class `[\da-z\.-]`).

-[  `.com` ]: as the top-level domain (TLD) (due to the `{2,6}` quantifier specifying 2 to 6 characters for the TLD).
